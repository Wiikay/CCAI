## Technical Architecture

The virtual agent is built with the following components:

- **Entity Types**: Structured data types for recognizing and processing user inputs (phone numbers, dates, names, etc.)
- **Intents**: Trained conversation models for understanding user requests
- **Flows**: Orchestrated conversation paths for handling different scenarios
- **Pages**: Individual interaction steps within each flow
- **Webhooks**: API integrations for verification and data retrieval

## Setup & Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Platform account with Dialogflow CX / CCAI enabled
- Access to webhook endpoints (currently configured at `tia-func-907971469140.us-central1.run.app`)

### Configuration

The agent comes with pre-configured settings:

- Default language: English
- Speech adaptation enabled for improved recognition
- DTMF (touch-tone) support for phone interactions
- Logging enabled for conversation analytics

## User Experience

The virtual agent provides a conversational interface with context-aware greetings based on time of day:

- "Good morning! Hello! I'm Mobile's virtual assistant. What can I assist you with today?"
- "Good afternoon! Hello! I'm Mobile's virtual assistant. What can I assist you with today?"
- "Good evening! Hello! I'm Mobile's virtual assistant. What can I assist you with today?"

## Extended Capabilities

- **Multi-channel Support**: Ready for voice, chat, and messaging platforms
- **Authentication Security**: Three-attempt limit before agent handoff
- **Integration Ready**: Webhook system for backend connectivity
